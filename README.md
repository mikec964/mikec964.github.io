I'm Mike Combs and welcome to my portfolio, of sorts. I'm at [GitHub.com/mikec964](https://github.com/mikec964), [LinkedIn.com/in/mcombs64](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcombs64) and [mike@combsnet.com](mail://mike@combsnet.com).

### Web, Python, and AWS
[RPG Tools](http://rpgtools2019.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/) is a blog developed in Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, deployed on AWS. (I don't use the blog.) It can extract the images from a PowerPoint Presentation and give you a zip file back. (I don't always run this, [email me](mail://mike@combsnet.com) to activate it.)

### Git Workflow 
[Feature Branch Workflow with Git](git-workflow-cheatsheet.pdf) is a cheat sheet that organizes commands and undos around a workflow. It's more helpful because the commands in context are more likely what you need, easier to learn and understand, and you can easily undo mistakes. The other cheat sheets I've seen are organized around basic and advanced commands and not any particular workflow.

### Data Science
[Meeple Matcher](http://rpubs.com/mike3d0g) examines a user's collection of modern board games to make recommendations. Written in 'tidy' R with unit tests, it uses an XML API, caching and extensive normalization to get 1.4M ratings of 280K games. Then it determines preferred mechanics and themes with random forest, and recommendations through a logistic regression. I used R Markdown and ggplot2 to generate reports.

## Reference Cards and Gaming Materials
Okay, this isn't part of my portfolio but I like to write and design clear instructions. This is the simple and stable URL for materials I've posted elsewhere.

* For [Savage Worlds](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Du7Lc_hIquyukmtMwSje6PMpt0P4Bw9z): Character sheets, and reference cards for combat rules, magic rules, chase rules, and tactics.
* [Board Game Bits](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18lh_AukZNVoDyBh_affUX1K1owJ0vgck?usp=sharing) including reference cards, set-up cards, organizers and more for Dune, Kitchen Rush, Serenissima, Space Alert, Space Cadets, Warhammer Quest the Adventure Card Game

Clear instructions are not always sufficient.
