This isn't much of a page, but it's a place to host sharable (completed)
projects.

My [Feature Branch Workflow with Git cheat sheet](git-workflow-cheatsheet.pdf) is organized around a workflow. I think it's more helpful because it puts the commands in context; the other cheat sheets I've seen are organized around basic and advanced. I also include the undo command for each command, putting them in the context of the workflow. **Updated July 13, 2019**
