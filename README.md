My [Feature Branch Workflow with Git cheat sheet](git-workflow-cheatsheet.pdf) is organized around a workflow. I think it's more helpful because it puts the commands in context so they're easier to learn and understand, and the commands you need are more likely to be found on this sheet. The other cheat sheets I've seen are organized around basic and advanced commands and not any particular workflow. I also include the undo for each command, and that context has gotta be helpful. **Updated July 13, 2019**
